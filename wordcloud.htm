			var text = "The ways to change a view cover the full set of all other design choices for idioms. A change could be made from one choice to another to change idioms, and any of the parameters for a particular  idiom can be changed. Any aspect of visual encoding can  be changed, including the ordering, any other choice pertaining  to the spatial arrangement, and the use of other visual channels  such as color. Changes could be made concerning what elements  are filtered, the level of detail of aggregation, and how the data is  partitioned into multiple views.  A change often requires a set of items or attributes within the  vis as input. There are several choices about how a user can select  elements: what kind of elements can be targets, how many  selection types are supported, how many elements can be in the  selected set, and how to highlight the elements.Navigation is a change of viewpoint; that is, changing what is  shown in a view based on the metaphor of a camera looking at the  scene from a moveable point of view. It’s a rich enough source  of design choices that it’s addressed separately in the framework  as a special case. Zooming in to see fewer items in more detail  can be done geometrically, matching the semantics of realworld  motion. With semantic zooming, the way to draw items  adapts on the fly based on the number of available pixels, so appearance  can change dramatically rather than simply shrinking or  enlarging. The camera metaphor also motivates the idea that attributes  are assigned to spatial dimensions, leading to the slice  idiom of extracting a single slice from the view volume and the cut  idiom of separating the volume into two parts with a plane and  eliminating everything on one side of it. The project idiom reduces  the number of dimensions using one of many possible transformations.";
